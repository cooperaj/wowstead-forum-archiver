# Wowstead.com Forum Archiver #

There comes a time where you want to move your Wowstead.com guild site somewhere else. But they don't make it easy, so I wrote this.

It exports to a vaguely sane sqlite DB which you should be able to transform into any format you need for import into a new system.

## Usage ##

1. Edit _ForumScraper.php_ with your site url.
2. In a terminal window run
    php ForumScraper.php
